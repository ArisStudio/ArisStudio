### Developing Aris Studio

If Sensei is a Developer and want to contributing code to Aris Studio, please follow these steps:

- We use [Editor Config](https://editorconfig.org/ "Editor Config") to keep code indentation, EOL, etc. persistent. If you're using the following code editor, please install their Editor Config extension.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig "Visual Studio Code Editor Config extension")
  - [Sublime Text](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime#readme "Sublime Text Editor Config extension")
- Use [Unity 2020.3.39f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2020 "Unity 2020.3.39f1").
- Fork and clone [Aris Studio](https://github.com/Tualin14/ArisStudio "Aris Studio") locally.
- Open Aris Studio in Unity. On the first time, there will be many errors in the console because the Spine runtime isn't present. Why don't we include [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/ "Spine") in Aris Studio already? Well, because of [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license "Spine Runtimes License Agreement"), we couldn't do that :(  

  Download and import [spine-unity 3.8 for Unity 2017.1-2020.3](https://esotericsoftware.com/files/runtimes/unity/spine-unity-3.8-2021-11-10.unitypackage "spine-unity 3.8 for Unity 2017.1-2020.3"), don't forget to uncheck "Spine Examples" while importing.
- Start your journey developing Aris Studio! :)  
  To know more about Aris Studio architecture and how to contributing on those field, visit [Aris Studio Documentation - Contribute section](https://as.t14.me/en/docs/category/contribute "Aris Studio Documentation - Contribute section").

### Documenting Aris Studio
